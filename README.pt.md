## About me
I have a degree in Civil Engineering, I am currently studying data science full-time. I am in the first period of data science.


Almost a year ago, I became a member of a DS community where I developed hands-on personal projects - regression, clustering, and classification - in which I acquired experience collecting, cleaning, and cleaning data, as well as building predictive models. With these projects, I was able to get a deeper understanding of statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization. Furthermore, I improved my problem-solving skills by applying the cyclic method (CRISP).

Also, in the community, I have the opportunity to share knowledge and experiences with community members through study groups, tutoring, and study groups.

I love solving complex problems and finding hidden patterns in data. With my analytical skills, I can turn data into actionable information (insights).

**Tools & Skills**

1. Data Visualization:
  - Power BI
  - Tableau
    
2. Programming Languages:
  - Python for Data Science:
    - Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn,
    - Statisics: Scipy, Statsmodels
    - Web Scraping: Beautiful Soup and Selenium
    - Data Visualization: Matplitlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
  - SQL
    
3. Statistics and Machine Learning
  - Descriptive and InferÃªncial statistics (dispersion, asymmetry, kurtosis, density, hypothesis tests, A/B Test).
  - Regression Algorithms, classification, and clustering.
  - Feature Selection Techniques.
  - Algorithm performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, Curva ROC, Lift Curve, AUC, Sillhoute score, elbow method).


# Projects

## [Health Insurance - Customer Sorting](https://github.com/BrenoTeixeira/health_insurance_ranking)

During this project, I developed and implemented a classification model aimed at ranking customers based on their potential interest in acquiring a new product, specifically, vehicle insurance. This initiative was crucial for optimizing the sales team's approach, allowing them to focus primarily on customers most likely to make a purchase. With this project, we expect to achieve 2.66 times more interested customers than randomly, with an expected revenue of $29,412,000. The model results were accessible via Google Sheets for added convenience. Tools used: Python, scikit-learn, Machine Learning, Google Sheets, Git and Github, SQL.

## [Rossmann - Sales Prediction](https://github.com/BrenoTeixeira/rossman-sales-prediction-project)


During this challenging project, I implemented an advanced sales forecasting model for an extensive pharmacy network in Europe using the Render platform. This model was developed to anticipate future sales (in monetary value) to assist the CFO in resource allocation for store renovations. The project's results not only significantly improved the accuracy of sales forecasts but also transformed how the management team interacted with these vital pieces of information. Integration with Telegram provided efficient and real-time communication, making this project a valuable contribution to the operational effectiveness of the pharmacy network. Tools used: Machine Learning, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Git, Github, and scikit-learn.

## [Insiders - Loyalty Program](https://github.com/BrenoTeixeira/insider_fidelity_program)

During this project, I conducted a customer segmentation analysis for the marketing team. I used clustering algorithms, including k-means, Gaussian Mixture Model, and Agglomerative Clustering, on a database containing customers' purchase history. I identified 10 customer segments to assist the marketing team in creating personalized offers for each group and in developing a loyalty program for the best-performing customer group. I developed this project using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and dimensionality reduction techniques.

## [Financial Dashboard](https://brenoteixeira.github.io/porfolio/financial-report)

In this project, I created a Power BI report with 7 interactive dashboards: Cash Flow Statement (DFC), Income Statement (DRE), Cash Flow Analysis, Profit Analysis, Expenses, Personnel Expenses, and Administrative Expenses. This report enabled managers to easily assess the company's financial situation and aided in identifying high-cost areas and optimization opportunities.

## [Price Monitoring](https://github.com/BrenoTeixeira/star_jeans_ETL_and_visualization)

In this project, I used Web scraping techniques (Beautiful Soup) to gather data from two competitors' websites. I processed the data using regular expressions (Regex) and other data-cleaning techniques, and then saved it to a Postgres database. To automate the entire process, I employed Airflow for task scheduling. Additionally, I created a PowerBI dashboard to monitor competitors' prices on a daily basis.

## [Insights Project](https://github.com/BrenoTeixeira/house-rocket-insights-project)

In this project, I conceived and implemented an innovative web application to help potential buyers identify real estate opportunities below the average price in a specific region. The application, developed using Python and the Streamlit library, integrates interactive maps and tables for a visual and informative experience.

## [Cardio Catch Disease](https://github.com/BrenoTeixeira/cardio_catch_disease)

In this project, I used Python, Statistics, and Classification Algorithms to predict early-stage heart diseases. The value of the diagnosis provided by the company is based on its accuracy. I developed this project to increase the company's profits by assisting the team responsible for diagnoses and thereby improving the accuracy of the results. Compared to the current situation, an 83.33% increase in profit per diagnosis is expected upon implementing the model. The predictions generated by the model have been made available in an accessible and organized spreadsheet on Google Sheets.
