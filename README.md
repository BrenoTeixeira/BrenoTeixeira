## About me
I have a degree in Civil Engineering, I am currently studying data science full-time. I am in the first period of data science.


Almost a year ago, I became a member of a DS community where I developed hands-on personal projects - regression, clustering, and classification - in which I acquired experience collecting, cleaning, and cleaning data, also building predictive models. With these projects, I was able to get a deeper understanding of statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization. Furthermore, I improved my problem-solving skills by applying the cyclic method (CRISP).

Also, in the community, I have the opportunity to share knowledge and experiences with community members through study groups, tutoring, and study groups.

I love solving complex problems and finding hidden patterns in data. With my analytical skills, I can turn data into actionable information (insights).

**Tools & Skills**

1. Data Visualization:
  - Power BI
  - Tableau
    
2. Programming Languages:
  - Python for Data Science:
    - Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn,
    - Statisics: Scipy, Statsmodels
    - Web Scraping: Beautiful Soup and Selenium
    - Data Visualization: Matplitlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
  - SQL
    
3. Statistics and Machine Learning
  - Descriptive and Infer√™ncial statistics (dispersion, asymmetry, kurtosis, density, hypothesis tests, A/B Test).
  - Regression Algorithms, classification, and clustering.
  - Feature Selection Techniques.
  - Algorithm performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, Curva ROC, Lift Curve, AUC, Sillhoute score, elbow method).


# Projects

## [Health Insurance - Customer Sorting](https://github.com/BrenoTeixeira/health_insurance_ranking)

I implemented a classification model that gives the score of propensity to purchase a new product to customers for the sales team. I collected data from a survey on the interest in purchasing car insurance, carried out by the company with 380,00 customers, performed data cleaning, feature engineering and trained a model to provide purchase propensity scores, and ordered a database with customers who were not interviewed. With this model, the sales team will be able to reach 42% of interested customers with 20,000 calls that are able to make; this means a 2.66 times better performance than the current method - random calls.

## [Rossmann - Sales Prediction](https://github.com/BrenoTeixeira/rossman-sales-prediction-project)

In this project, I used Python, Statistics, and supervised machine learning techniques (Regression Algorithms) to forecast sales for the next six weeks at Rossmann stores ‚Äî a chain of pharmacies in Europe. The final product of this project was a Telegram Bot that returns the sales forecast when receiving the number of one of the stores. This allows forecasts to be accessed from anywhere.

## [Dashboard Financeiro](https://brenoteixeira.github.io/porfolio/financial-report)

Neste projeto eu criei um relat√≥rio no Power BI com 7 Dashboards interativos: Demonstra√ß√£o de Fluxo de Caixa (DFC), Demonstra√ß√£o de Resultado do Exerc√≠cio (DRE), An√°lise de Fluxo de Caixa, An√°lise de Resultado, Despesas, Despesas com Pessoal e Despesas Administrativas. Esse relat√≥rio permitiu que os gerentes verificassem facilmente a situa√ß√£o financeira da empresa, e os ajudou a identificar √°reas de alto custo e oportunidades de otimiza√ß√£o.

## [Insiders - Loyalty Program](https://github.com/BrenoTeixeira/insider_fidelity_program)

During this project, I conducted a customer segmentation analysis for the marketing team. I used clustering algorithms, including k-means, Gaussian Mixture Model, and Agglomerative Clustering, on a database containing customers' purchase history. I identified 10 customer segments to assist the marketing team in creating personalized offers for each group and in developing a loyalty program for the best-performing customer group. I developed this project using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, T-SNE, UMAP).

## [Dashboard Financeiro](https://brenoteixeira.github.io/porfolio/financial-report)

In this project, I created a Power BI report with 7 interactive dashboards: Cash Flow Statement (DFC), Income Statement (DRE), Cash Flow Analysis, Profit Analysis, Expenses, Personnel Expenses, and Administrative Expenses. This report enabled managers to easily assess the company's financial situation and aided in identifying high-cost areas and optimization opportunities.

## [Price Monitoring](https://github.com/BrenoTeixeira/star_jeans_ETL_and_visualization)

In this project, I used Webscraping techniques (Beautiful Soup) to gather data from two competitors' websites. I processed the data using regular expressions (Regex) and other data-cleaning techniques, and then saved it to a Postgres database. To automate the entire process, I employed Airflow for task scheduling. Additionally, I created a PowerBI dashboard to monitor competitors' prices on a daily basis.

## [Insights Project](https://github.com/BrenoTeixeira/house-rocket-insights-project)

In this project, I conceived and implemented an innovative web application with the goal of helping potential buyers identify real estate opportunities below the average price in a specific region. The application, developed using Python and the Streamlit library, integrates interactive maps and tables for a visual and informative experience.

## [Cardio Catch Disease](https://github.com/BrenoTeixeira/cardio_catch_disease)

In this project, I used Python, Statistics, and Classification Algorithms to predict early-stage heart diseases. The value of the diagnosis provided by the company is based on its accuracy. I developed this project with the aim of increasing the company's profits by assisting the team responsible for diagnoses and thereby improving the accuracy of the results. Compared to the current situation, an 83.33% increase in profit per diagnosis is expected upon implementing the model. The predictions generated by the model have been made available in an accessible and organized spreadsheet on Google Sheets.
