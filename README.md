## About me
I have a degree in Civil Engineering, I am currently studying data science full-time. I am in the first period of data science.


Almost a year ago, I became a member of a DS community where I developed hands-on personal projects - regression, clustering, and classification - in which I acquired experience collecting, cleaning, and cleaning data, also building predictive models. With these projects, I was able to get a deeper understanding of statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization. Furthermore, I improved my problem-solving skills by applying the cyclic method (CRISP).

Also, in the community, I have the opportunity to share knowledge and experiences with community members through study groups, tutoring, and study groups.

I love solving complex problems and finding hidden patterns in data. With my analytical skills, I can turn data into actionable information (insights).

**Tools & Skills**

1. Data Visualization:
  - Power BI
  - Tableau
    
2. Programming Languages:
  - Python for Data Science:
    - Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn,
    - Statisics: Scipy, Statsmodels
    - Web Scraping: Beautiful Soup and Selenium
    - Data Visualization: Matplitlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
  - SQL
    
3. Statistics e Machine Learning
  - Descriptive and InferÃªncial statistics (dispersion, asymmetry, kurtosis, density, hypothesis tests, A/B Test).
  - Regression Algorithms, classification, and clustering.
  - Feature Selection Techniques.
  - Algorithm performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, Curva ROC, Lift Curve, AUC, Sillhoute score, elbow method).


# Projects

## [Health Insurance - OrdenaÃ§Ã£o de Clientes](https://github.com/BrenoTeixeira/health_insurance_ranking)

I implemented a classification model that gives the score of propensity to purchase a new product to customers for the sales team. I collected data from a survey on the interest in purchasing car insurance, carried out by the company with 380,00 customers, performed data cleaning, feature engineering and trained a model to provide purchase propensity scores, and ordered a database with customers who were not interviewed. With this model, the sales team will be able to reach 42% of interested customers with 20,000 calls that are able to make; this means a 2.66 times better performance than the current method - random calls.


## [Rossmann - Sales Prediction](https://github.com/BrenoTeixeira/rossman-sales-prediction-project)

In this project, I used Python, Statistics, and supervised machine learning techniques (Regression Algorithms) to forecast sales for the next six weeks at Rossmann stores â€” a chain of pharmacies in Europe. The final product of this project was a Telegram Bot that returns the sales forecast when receiving the number of one of the stores. This allows forecasts to be accessed from anywhere.

## [Insiders - Loyalty Program](https://github.com/BrenoTeixeira/insider_fidelity_program)

Performed a customer segmentation analysis for the marketing team. I used clustering algorithms (k-means, Gaussian Mixture Model, and Agglomerative Clustering) in a database containing the customers' purchase history. I identified 10 customer segments to help the marketing team make personalized offers for each group and create a loyalty program for the best customer group. I developed this project using Python, pandas scikit-learn, and dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, T-SNE, UMAP).
