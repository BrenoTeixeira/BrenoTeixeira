## About me
I have a degree in Civil Engineering, I am currently studying data science full-time. I am in the first period of data science.


Almost a year ago, I became a member of a DS community where I developed hands-on personal projects - regression, clustering, and classification - in which I acquired experience collecting, cleaning, and cleaning data, also building predictive models. With these projects, I was able to get a deeper understanding of statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization. Furthermore, I improved my problem-solving skills by applying the cyclic method (CRISP).

Also, in the community, I have the opportunity to share knowledge and experiences with community members through study groups, tutoring, and study groups.

I love solving complex problems and finding hidden patterns in data. With my analytical skills, I can turn data into actionable information (insights).
